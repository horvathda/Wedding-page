    Questions and Answers

    travel and accomodations:

      Will there be some kind of organized transfer?
      No, we'll just meet at the church at 13:15.

      Where can I park?
      Parking is free on the weekends in the 1st district. The locations are close to each other so you won't need your car.

      How can I get home at night?
      The 916 bus is in service all night at the castle and it hits every major traffic hub in the city.

    food and festivities:

      I'd like to do some kind of surprise for you guys at the party. To whom should I talk about this?
      Discuss it with Abigail Smith. Just drop her an email at abigail@awesomemail.com.

      What should I wear? Do you have a dress code?
      Wear what's comfortable to you. If it helps smart casual / business casual for the ladies and smart casual / informal for the gentlemen are perfect options.

      I would like some kind of special food (gluten-free, lactose-free, vegan etc.)
      Drop us a line here and we'll find a way.

      I have a problem / question on the wedding day. With whom can I speak?
      Jared Wright on this number: +36 30 000 0000.

      Can we bring kids?
      Sure! We planned a whole toy / sweets corner for them.

      How do you feel about dogs? Can I bring mine?
      We love dogs and you can absolutely bring yours. The Heaven Lounge is a dog-friendly place.
